Scripts used for Guided Research at NIOZ with Dr. Matthew Humphreys:
*The carbonate system on the long-term in the Dutch coastal zone: ocean acidification in reverse?*

February 2022

-> Method sections: run first these in this specific order to make the datasets used in this study

# 3_2_Save_datasets

# 3_3_1_Spatial_variability # includes figures 4 and S3 
*Salinity normalization*

# 3_3_2_Temporal_variability # inludes figures 5 and S4
*Seasonal bias correction*

# 3_4_1_Verification_model # includes figures 10 and S6
*pH prediction on TA, pCO2AIR and fCO2SW measurements*

# 3_4_2_Drivers_ph_seasonality_2 # includes figures 11, 12 and S7
